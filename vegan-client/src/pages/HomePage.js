          Have you ever thought of skipping meat in your diet or are you already
          in the willing process of achieving a completely plant-based diet…but
          you can't get over your breakfast routine with some nice fresh
          scrambled eggs? Lets not start to talk about melted cheese…
          <br />I know, it's hard to resist. But hat's why you are here.
        </p>
        <p>
          The goal of this community will be to tell you about the benefits of a
          vegan diet - taste-wise!
        </p>
        <p>
          I am convinced that the vegan diet is not mostly about resisting and
          missing, but about creativity and curiosity, checking out new tastes,
          new combinations and on top of it all, living a more environmentally
          friendly life.

        <p>
          In the 1950s, according to popular opinion, a complete meal usually
          consisted of meat, vegetables and potatoes. But times are changing and
          many people increasingly want to live without eating meat. Some do so
          for health reasons, while others no longer want to support factory
          farming.
        </p>

        <p>
          Meanwhile, the renunciation is also really easy, because there are
          enough meat alternatives that really do not have to hide in terms of
          taste. Lets take a closer look at the tastiest products, some of which
          you can prepare just like real meat:
        </p>
      </div>
      <div id="substitutes">
        <h2>1. Tofu</h2>
        <p>
          The best known and most popular alternative to meat is certainly tofu,
          also known as soy curd. Tofu has a long tradition in Asia, and
          vegetarians and vegans in this country also like to use it. Tofu is
          made from soy milk with the help of a special salt, which coagulates
          the milk. Since the taste is neutral, tofu can be used very versatile
          in the kitchen, because it can be used to create both savory and sweet
          dishes.
          <br />
          If you want to make sweet dishes, use silken tofu, which has a creamy
          consistency. Tofu is easy to digest and provides your body with a lot
          of protein. If you crumble it, you can make a delicious vegan
          bolognese. You can also marinate it or use smoked tofu. You can use
          the latter instead of bacon or ham.
        </p>
        <h2>2. Tempeh</h2>
        <p>
          Unlike tofu, tempeh is made from whole soybeans that have been
          steamed, hulled and fermented beforehand. The fermentation is done
          with the help of certain noble molds, which also give tempeh its
          characteristic flavor.
          <br />
          The consistency is firm and sliceable, which is why tempeh is usually
          sliced and fried. Alternatively, you can also deep-fry tempeh. There
          are many recipe ideas with tempeh. For example, how about ginger
          pomegranate tempeh?
          <br />
          Due to the fermentation, tempeh is also tolerated by many who cannot
          eat normal soy. You can bread tempeh like a cutlet, use it deep-fried
          like bacon or fried in a salad or with vegetables. If you crumble the
          tempeh you can also use it as an alternative to ground meat.
        </p>
        <h2>3. Seitan</h2>
        <p>
          The basis for making seitan is wheat protein, or gluten. Wheat flour
          and water are kneaded into a dough, which is then left to rest in
          water. By kneading it steadily, the starch comes out, so that
          eventually a rubbery mass is formed. Seitan differs from tofu in that
          it is more firm to the bite. Ready-made meat alternatives made from
          seitan are often offered in stores. Or how about kebab meat made from
          seitan?
          <br />
          You can also mix seitan powder yourself and then make sausages, steaks
          or schnitzels from it. You can slice the seitan and fry it or dice it
          to make goulash. Seitan contains a large amount of protein, but
          unfortunately it is not very bioavailable. For this reason, you should
          add other vegan protein sources to your diet. Its also possible to
          make flour to a seitan dough by yourself:

        </iframe>
        </p>
        <h2>4. Jackfruit</h2>
        <p>
          Unlike most meat alternatives, jackfruit is unfortunately not such a
          good source of protein. The tree fruit, which originated in southern
          India, has a very low energy content. For these reasons, it is not an
          equivalent substitute for meat, but is becoming increasingly popular
          with vegetarians and vegans. It has even made it among the biggest
          food trends.
          <br />
          This is primarily due to the fact that the consistency is very similar
          to chicken. That's why jackfruit is often made into fricassee or
          served as vegetable pulled pork. The taste of jackfruit can be
          described as neutral, with a slightly acidic note. In the trade you
          can buy the still unripe, green fruit in a can. The similarity to
          chicken or pulled pork/beef is incredible. Although its highly
          recommended to add some vitamin and protein containing greens to your
          recipe when you cook with Jackfruit due to the low energy content of
          the product itself.
        </p>
        <h2>5. Soy meat</h2>
        <p>
          For the production of soy meat, also known as TVP, after grinding the
          soybeans, the oil is almost completely removed by pressing. The
          resulting soybean meal then goes into an extruder, which gives it its
          porous structure.
          <br />
          Since soy meat has no real flavor of its own, you must soak it in
          vegetable broth before preparing it, as this is the only way it can be
          processed further. It tastes like meat only when you refine it with
          different spices. You can use the soy meat as an alternative for
          goulash, minced meat, steaks or cutlets.
        </p>
        <h2>6. Lupins</h2>
        <p>
          Lupins are among the legumes and are very similar to soybeans, but
          they are grown in our regions. Similar to the way soybeans are
          processed into tofu, lupine seeds are also treated. Tofu made from
          lupines has a nutty flavor and is popular in the form of sausages or
          burger patties.
          <br />
          Since this tofu is more expensive than the classic soy tofu, it has
          not yet been able to quite reach its popularity. Lupine tofu has a
          fibrous structure very close to that of meat. Lupine is very
          digestible, does not receive gluten, and you can also use the flour
          for baking.
        </p>
        <h2>7. Legumes</h2>
        <p>
          In addition to sweet lupins, there are a number of legumes that can
          serve as meat alternatives. Among others, beans, lentils, chickpeas
          and peas are suitable for this purpose. Pea protein is often used to
          make cutlets or sausage. In addition, lentils are often made into
          vegan mince.
          <br />
          Pulses are also grown in our latitudes, so they have a positive
          ecological balance. However, there is a lot of processing, so meat
          substitutes made from legumes can have a lot of additives. However,
          they do provide your body with plenty of protein.
        </p>
        <h2>8. Grains</h2>
        <p>
          You probably know grains such as green spelt or bulgur primarily as
          ingredients in salads, or they are processed into baked goods.
          However, they are now increasingly found in meat substitutes. Vegans
          can eat a nutritious and wholesome diet with such products.
          <br />
          Bulgur is a great alternative to minced meat, so you can use it to
          make bolognese or stuff vegetables. In Turkish cuisine, for example,
          it is used to make köfte. Bulgur is pre-cooked durum wheat, so it is
          characterised by a fast cooking time. Green spelt is the unripe spelt
          that is mostly used to make roast patties. Grains are extremely
          versatile in cooking, in principle you can use any for this. Oatmeal
          or millet are also very common.
        </p>
        <h2>9. Mushrooms</h2>
        <p>
          What many people probably don't know is that you can also use
          mushrooms as a meat alternative. This is partly because of their
          excellent consistency and partly because of their valuable
          ingredients. However, since the protein content can't keep up with
          meat, you'll have to find other sources of protein.
          <br /> 
          Portobello, also known as giant mushroom, has a considerable
          diameter, so you can use it as a pattie for your burger. Marinate it
          with a little olive oil, vinegar, onion and garlic. You can also bread
          this mushroom well, like a cutlet. Other recommended mushrooms are
          shiitake or oyster mushrooms for making patties or goulash.
