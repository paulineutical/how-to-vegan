            <p>Have you ever thought of skipping meat in your diet or are you already in the willing process of achieving a completely plant-based diet…but you can't get over your breakfast routine with some nice fresh scrambled eggs? Lets not start to talk about melted cheese…<br/>
            I know, it's hard to resist. But hat's why you are here.</p>
            <p>The goal of this community will be to tell you about the benefits of a vegan diet - taste-wise! </p>
            <p>I am convinced that the vegan diet is not mostly about resisting and missing, but about creativity and curiosity, checking out new tastes, new combinations and on top of it all, living a more environmentally friendly life.</p>
